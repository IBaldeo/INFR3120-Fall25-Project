Project Idea:

Both Ali and Ian have been brainstorming a few ideas for out project but in the end,
we decided to go with a incident management system. This makes it possible to showcase our
skills in web and script programming as it includes every major part of a web application.

The incident management system would essentially take values from the user which would be both in
numbers, text and date data and then push that data into a makeshift online database, which then
would be displayed on a makeshift dashboard on another page. 

Later on, a login system would be implemented that would allow users to create incidents and view
incidents. This would be very important so that random people that stumble upon the site cannot, view
or create incidents.

Member Roles:

Ali: Frontend, Web Page, CSS, and HTML
Ian: Incident Form, Incident Display, and Optimization
Both: Login, Database, and Incident Implementation

Code Source:

Majority of the code was written from scratch and used directly from the lectures and videos from
the lectures. There was some code that was taken from W3Schools which was only the Navbar code, which
was later heavily modified to fit using the lectures once again.
